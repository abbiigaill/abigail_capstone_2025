# Project Overview 

Behind every missing person statistic is a family waiting for answers and a community left with uncertainty. This project goes beyond numbers — it is about recognizing the human weight of these cases while using data to bring clarity where there is often confusion
This project will analyze missing persons data across the United States, with a special focus on Tennessee. By combining case-level missing person reports with U.S. Census population data, the analysis will identify trends, demographic patterns, and geographic hotspots. The outcome will be a clear, data-driven picture of who is most at risk and where missing person cases are most concentrated.

# Motivation

Missing-person cases are socially and emotionally critical events; understanding patterns can help target prevention and allocate resources.

As someone learning to use data for meaningful insights, I see this project as an opportunity to apply analytics in service of a real-world issue that touches families, law enforcement, and policymakers. My goal is to make the findings both technically sound and accessible — creating tools and visuals that don’t just inform but also resonate with people who care about safety in their communities.

Ultimately, the motivation behind this project is simple: to make a meaningful difference in how missing person data is understood, shared, and used to bring people home.


# Questions

•	Trend Analysis: How have missing person cases changed over time nationally and in Tennessee?

•	Demographics: Which age, gender, or racial groups are most represented among missing persons relative to population?

•	Geographic Patterns: Which Tennessee counties have the highest missing person rates (per 100,000 population)?

•	Comparisons: How does Tennessee compare to national averages?



# Problems and Hurdles

Data quality and availability (not all cases may be reported consistently).




# Technologies Used

Python / Pandas - for analyzing and aggregation of the dataset
PowerBi- for creating an interactive dashboard
Git - for version control

# Data Sources

To answer the above questions I used the following sources to collect datasets for my analysis

•	Missing Persons Data: https://namus.nij.ojp.gov/

•	Population Data: https://www.census.gov/topics/population/data.html

•	Population Data for Tennessee County-levels: Census.gov : https://www.census.gov/topics/population/data.html

# Conclusion

The Missing Person Dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of 9,159 recorded missing person cases across the United States from 2015-2024. By combining demographic, geographic, and temporal data, the dashboard reveals key insights into the patterns and trends surrounding missing person cases.

Analysis of the data highlights that cases span a wide range of ages, with notable representation among adolescents (0–17) and older adults (55+). Both males and females are represented, with slightly varying trends depending on location. The data also shows that states such as Texas, California, and Flordia report higher numbers of missing persons, likely reflecting population density and reporting practices.

Within Tennessee, the data reveals notable variations between counties, with higher numbers of reported cases in urban and densely populated regions such as Sullivan, Shelby, and Davidson Counties. These areas show recurring cases involving both youth (ages 0–17) and adults aged 35–54, underscoring the broad impact of missing person incidents across different age groups. Smaller rural counties report fewer cases, but their data remains vital in identifying emerging local trends and resource needs.

The demographic breakdown shows that both males and females are represented across all regions, with a visible presence of White / Hispanic and Other racial groups. Visualizing this information through maps and charts allows users to quickly identify where cases are most concentrated and how demographic factors correlate with location and time.

Through visualizations of metrics like case counts by state, age distribution, and gender/race breakdowns, the dashboard turns raw data into actionable insights. These findings can support law enforcement, researchers, and the public in recognizing trends and prioritizing prevention efforts.

Overall, the Missing Person Dashboard demonstrates how data analytics and visualization can contribute to social impact — improving awareness, aiding investigations, and fostering community engagement in the effort to bring missing individuals home.
